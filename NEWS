- Fix hook for GNU's error_at_line() not exiting if status != 0. If
  error_one_per_line was used and suppressed a message, then error_at_line()
  didn't exit.
- Fix race condition when using threads. The fix requires thread-local
  storage (available on at least GNU/Linux and FreeBSD).
- Documentation updates.
